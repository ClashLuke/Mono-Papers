### Conditions
#### Presale
This is a private presale. Known investors and miners are allowed to invest ethereum to get their MONO Token. The presale allows investors to buy tokens 10% cheaper. In addition, another 20% discount 
can be achieved by trading in one Clash [CLS], totalling in a 30% discount for pre-sale investors. One CLS reduces the price of one MMONO (Million MONO) by exactly 20%.

#### ICO
The MONO ICO is public, therefore regulations are needed. Additionally, previously mentioned bonusses do not apply. MONO utilises a standard KYC model. A verification of an investors using their full name, date of birth, nationality and in, case more than 150 ETH are used to purchase MONO, an AML aswell. The general process of an KYC can be seen [here](https://medium.com/theacorncollective/a-step-by-step-guide-to-completing-acorns-kyc-process-5a619c13b2a6).

### Value
Since there is no discount in the ICO, the price is set to 0.01 ETH (1 USD) per MMONO. During the presale, it is 90ct or 70ct respectively. There are six months premined, with the emission discussed [here](https://github.com/ClashLuke/Mono-Papers/blob/master/whitepaper.md), this results in 8,100,000 MMONO that are premined. 8.1 Million of these are available for the ICO resulting in a hardcap of 8.1 Million US Dollar for this ICO to rise.
